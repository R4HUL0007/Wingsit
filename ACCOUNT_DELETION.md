# Account Deletion Feature

## Overview

The account deletion feature allows users to permanently delete their account and all associated data. This includes automatic cleanup of follower/following relationships and all related content.

## Backend Implementation

### Route
- **DELETE** `/api/users/account` - Delete user account (requires authentication)

### Controller Function: `deleteUserAccount`

The function performs the following cleanup operations in order:

#### 1. **Password Verification**
- Requires user's password for security
- Validates password before proceeding with deletion

#### 2. **Follower/Following Cleanup**
```javascript
// Remove user from all followers' following lists
await User.updateMany(
  { _id: { $in: userFollowers } },
  { $pull: { following: userId } }
);

// Remove user from all following users' followers lists
await User.updateMany(
  { _id: { $in: userFollowing } },
  { $pull: { followers: userId } }
);
```

#### 3. **Post Interactions Cleanup**
- Removes user from liked posts
- Removes user from bookmarked posts
- Deletes all user's posts
- Removes user's comments from all posts

#### 4. **Communication Cleanup**
- Deletes all user's notifications (sent and received)
- Deletes all user's messages (sent and received)
- Deletes all user's feedback submissions

#### 5. **Media Cleanup**
- Deletes profile image from Cloudinary
- Deletes cover image from Cloudinary

#### 6. **Final Deletion**
- Deletes the user document from database
- Clears JWT cookie for immediate logout

## Frontend Implementation

### Components

#### DeleteAccountModal
- **Location**: `frontend/src/pages/profile/DeleteAccountModal.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Two-step confirmation process
  - Password verification

#### ProfilePage Integration
- **Location**: `frontend/src/pages/profile/ProfilePage.jsx`

### User Flow

1. **User clicks "Delete Account"** on their profile page
2. **First confirmation** - Shows warning and list of what will be deleted
3. **Second confirmation** - Requires password entry
4. **Account deletion** - Backend processes all cleanup operations
5. **Success** - User is logged out and redirected to signup page

   - User with messages and notifications

2. **Edge Cases**
   - User with no followers/following
   - User with no posts
   - User with no profile/cover images

3. **Security Tests**

## Database Impact

### Collections Affected
- `users` - Main user deletion
- `posts` - Post deletion and comment cleanup
- `notifications` - Notification cleanup

- `feedback` - Feedback cleanup

### Index Considerations
- Follower/following arrays are automatically updated
- Post like/bookmark arrays are automatically updated
- No orphaned references remain

## Performance Considerations

- Bulk operations for follower/following cleanup
- Efficient array operations using `$pull`
- Cloudinary operations are non-blocking
- Transaction-like behavior for data consistency

## Future Enhancements

- Soft delete option (deactivate instead of delete)
- Data export before deletion
- Admin-initiated account deletion
- Deletion scheduling (30-day grace period)
